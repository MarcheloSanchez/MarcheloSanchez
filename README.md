# 👋 Hello, I'm Marchelo Sanchez

> 🧪 Software Test Engineer | Automation & Quality

## 🚀 About Me

I'm a Medior Software Tester with a passion for quality assurance and test automation. With my ISTQB Foundation and Advanced (Test Analyst) certifications, I bring a methodical approach to ensuring software reliability and performance.

Quality isn’t just testing — it’s a mindset.
### 💡 My Testing Philosophy
- Quality is not an act, it's a habit
- Double-checking is not paranoia, it's professionalism
- Organization and structure lead to better test coverage
